# Overview

This project is a full-stack personal website built from scratch as part of the AggieWorks SWE takehome project. Yes it has a backend, more on that later. This site is built using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. It is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://jerryowu.com](https://jerryowu.com). The project was completed in approximately 1 week.

# Cool Features

### Reading Page

The backend plays a crucial role in this section. To ensure sensitive information remains secure from the client, I've implemented a login feature that authenticates users on the backend. Logging in unlocks access to more advanced features that interact with the backend. Please log in to fully explore the site's capabilities!
