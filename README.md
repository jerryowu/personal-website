# personal-website

This project was created from scratch as part of the AggieWorks SWE takehome project. It is a full-stack personal website built using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. The site is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed at https://jerryowu.com/. The project was completed in approximately 1 week. If you have any comments, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to email me at mrjerryowu@gmail.com.

# cool parts about the website

## Image Stacks

The stacks of images are flippable by clicking! It creates a realistic animation of flipping the image stack, and the direction of flipping is RNG.

## Reading Page

The reading page is probably my most favorite. Here is the login info if you want to play around:

Username: username
Password: password

My favorite features include the ability to drag and drop and mark books as bangers. You can also of course add, edit, and delete books.

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site.
